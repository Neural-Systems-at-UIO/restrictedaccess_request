# access_data_email

An app aiming to solve this issue: https://gitlab.ebrains.eu/kanban/curators/ebrains-curation-team/-/issues/129

A vanilla javascript backend app (express node server) running on Rancher (kubernetes). Written in Node 20.17.0

The app sends an automatic email to data custodian informing about submitted request to access externally hosted data.

Users send requests using nettskjema (id=127835), where they provide dataset title and dataset id, which is by default the id of the dataset version. When nettskjema is sent, a dedicated zammad ticket is created and zammad webhook sends a POST request to an endpoint of the application. Zammad webhook should contain the nettskjema url: https://nettskjema.no/user/form/127835/submission/{submission_id} and the corresponding zammad ticket number. Submission_id is used to extract information about the requested dataset from the Nettskjema API. Using dataset version id, we fetch contact information of the data custodian from the Knowledge Graph API and forward request to the data custodian's email. The app sends an CC-email to the curation team with the ticket number in the email subject.

In order to fetch information from the Knowledge Graph API, we set up a service account as described here: https://docs.kg.ebrains.eu/8387ccd27a186dea3dd0b949dc528842/authentication.html#how-to-get-your-token
Service account needs permision to access contact information of the data custodians in both spaces: "RELEASED" and "IN_PROGRESS".

The entry file of the application is serverEmailAutomat.js (express node server).

To launch the server:

```
$ npm start
```

In development mode:

```
$ npm run dev
```

In local webbrowser:

```
http://localhost:4000/
```

Using KG editor, we manually defined a query named "fetch_data_custodian_info" to fetch information about requested datasets.  
The defined query: https://query.kg.ebrains.eu/queries/de7e79ae-5b67-47bf-b8b0-8c4fa830348e

To test a webhook, type in PowerShell:

```
$headers = @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"}
$body = @{
     message = "Application is running"}
$jsonBody = $body | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4000/test" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $jsonBody
```

To try a webhook endpoint, in PowerShell:

```
$headers = @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"}
$body = @{
     event = "data request"
     data = @{submission_id = "https://nettskjema.no/user/form/127835/submission/{submission_id}}"}
 }
$jsonBody = $body | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4000/webhook" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $jsonBody
```

# Using console from Browser Developer Tools:

```
fetch('http://localhost:4000/webhook', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    event: 'test event',
    data: {
      submission_id: 'https://nettskjema.no/user/form/127835/submission/{submission_id}'
    }
  })
})
.then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  }
  return response.json();
})
.then(data => console.log('Success:', data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```

Email replay:

To test email sending using private gmail account, setup app password as described here:

To deploy on Rancher:

1. All env variable should be on place, it is not possible to change or add anything after deployment is complete.
2. Follow this instruction for deployment: https://handbook.ebrains.eu/docs/technical-deep-dive/engineering/devops-practices/kubernetes/#issue-a-certificate-for-a-domain-under-appsebrainseu
   And here: https://github.com/ehennestad/ebrains_wizard_eh/wiki/Workflow:-Build-and-Push-Dev-Image
   Harbor Docker Registry: https://docker-registry.ebrains.eu/harbor/
3. Setup namespace at Rancher, use github actions, install GitHub actions extension to VS code.
4. Create .github folder in the root of the repository, add workflows folder and .yaml file where deployment process will be described.
5. After container is deployed, setup service, sertificate and ingress
6. URL should be approved by rancher admin

The application is here:
https://restrictedaccess.apps.ebrains.eu

Get requests for health check can be sent here:
https://restrictedaccess.apps.ebrains.eu/health

Endpoint to send POST requests for webhook:
https://restrictedaccess.apps.ebrains.eu/webhook

The application entry file is: serverEmailAutomat.js

To try if application reacts to webhook, in PowerShell:

```
$headers = @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"}
$body = @{
     event = "data request"
     data = @{submission_id = "https://nettskjema.no/user/form/127835/submission/{submission_id}}"}
 }
$jsonBody = $body | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://restrictedaccess.apps.ebrains.eu/webhook" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $jsonBody
```

For testing using Postman:
https://restrictedaccess.apps.ebrains.eu/webhook?trials=testwebhook
http://localhost:4000/webhook?trials=testwebhook

emails are sent via Zammad api
https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket/articles.html#create

If you have to redeploy, don't delete the namespace. Just what you created/deployed there ( deployments, secrets, services etc).

Gitlab issue: https://gitlab.ebrains.eu/kanban/curators/ebrains-curation-team/-/issues/163#note_1144130

To create clients for accessing netttskjema: https://authorization.nettskjema.no/client

to get token to access Zammad, log in to Zammad, generate token with permissions : ticket.agent, ticket.customer

My personal token 'get_ticket_info' is used for this app, no expiration date set.

Redeployment steps:

1. delete deployment
2.
